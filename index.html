       <h1>Shaping Things (2005)</h1> 

       <h2>By Bruce Sterling</h2>

        <p>
        If I had to guess, I'd say 30 years. In 30 years, things properly understood as <strong >Spimes</strong> will be around us. 
        
        Mind you, this is by no means an entirely happy prospect. It's <em>important</em> to acknowledge the downsides of any technological <em>transformation</em> - to "think of the underside first", to think in a precautionary way.

        Nothing new there - fire is two million years old. It helps to learn about fire and its remarkable affordances. Not a lot is to be gained by simply flinging lit matches.

        This book is for designers who want to be active agents in a technosocial world. I can't make you into a moral angel (because I'm not one myself and have little interest in being one), but I might help you understand that a future can be yours to make.

<h1>To have without holding</h1>
<h2>BY MARGE PIERCY</h2>
<p>
Learning to love differently is hard,
love with the hands wide open, love
with the doors banging on their hinges,
the cupboard unlocked, the wind
roaring and whimpering in the rooms
rustling the sheets and snapping the blinds
that thwack like rubber bands
in an open palm.</p>
<p>
It hurts to love wide open
stretching the muscles that feel
as if they are made of wet plaster,
then of blunt knives, then
of sharp knives.
</p>
<p>
It hurts to thwart the reflexes
of grab, of clutch ; to love and let
go again and again. It pesters to remember
the lover who is not in the bed,
to hold back what is owed to the work
that gutters like a candle in a cave
without air, to love consciously,
conscientiously, concretely, constructively.
</p>
<p>
I can’t do it, you say it’s killing
me, but you thrive, you glow
on the street like a neon raspberry,
You float and sail, a helium balloon
bright bachelor’s button blue and bobbing
on the cold and hot winds of our breath,
as we make and unmake in passionate
diastole and systole the rhythm
of our unbound bonding, to have
and not to hold, to love
with minimized malice, hunger
and anger moment by moment balanced.
