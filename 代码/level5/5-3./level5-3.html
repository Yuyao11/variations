        <h1>Pond</h1>
        <h2>BY GREGORY ORR</h2>
        <p>Snapping turtles in the pond eat bass, sunfish,<br>
        and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim.<br>
        But early this spring two Canada geese<br>
        lingered, then built a nest. What Iâ€™d<br>
        heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings,<br>
        as they paddle about, grabbed from below<br>
        by a snapper, pulled down to drown.<br>
        So he stuck<br>
        
        hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered hooks<br>
        attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys.<br>
        The first week he caught three turtles<br>
        and still there are more: sometimes he finds<br>
        the bottles dragged ashore, the wire<br>
        wrapped several times around a pine trunk<br>
        and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin.</p>
